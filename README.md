# SBS-seq
SBS-seq is a method for identifying the high-resolution complete sequence-specificity of sulfur binding domains (SBD).
SBS-seq involves in vitro selection of SBD-binding phosphorothioate (PT)-DNA substrates from a library covering all possible sequences, and subsequent deep-sequencing.
Three representative SBDs were characterized at single-base resolution.This work provides insights for research on modification-dependent REases and facilitates potential biotechnology applications of SBDs.
